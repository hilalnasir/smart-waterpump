# Smart Pump Control Simulation for Water Systems

This MATLAB simulation models a closed-loop PID control system for managing the water level in a tank, simulating conditions relevant to municipal water infrastructure.

## Features
- PID control with adjustable gains
- Realistic inflow and outflow dynamics
- Data logging to CSV
- Water level visualization over time

## How to Run
1. Open `smart_pump_sim.m` in MATLAB or Octave.
2. Run the script.
3. View the plotted graph of water level.
4. Open `sim_output.csv` to analyze simulation results.

## Output
- `sim_output.csv`: Contains time, water level, error, and inflow rate.
- A graph showing water level stability over time.

## Applications
- Demonstrates basic PID control logic in infrastructure contexts
- Transferable to water treatment, pump control, and embedded systems applications
